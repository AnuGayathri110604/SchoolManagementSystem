# School Management System

Welcome to the School Management System project! This Java application offers user registration (sign-up) and login functionalities for a school management system.

## Features

- **User Registration (Sign-up):**
  - New users can create an account by providing their name, email, password, and confirming the password.
  - The system checks the strength of the password to ensure security requirements are met.
  - Upon registration, users are assigned a random Personal Identification Number (PIN).

- **User Login:**
  - Registered users can conveniently log in using their credentials.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Required to compile and run Java applications.
- **MySQL Server:** The database system used for data storage.
